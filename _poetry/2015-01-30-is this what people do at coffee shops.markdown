the only feeling i can 
<br>
relate to at the moment 
<br>
is the desire to melt into the floor
<br>
while listening to Tame Impala
<br>
<br>
i am so bored with myself
<br>
that i want to light myself on fire
<br>
to remind myself
<br>
that i can still feel things
<br>
<br>
i’m watching the ice melt in my coffee
<br>
is this what it feels like 
<br>
when people start forgetting you
<br>
do you just get absorbed into
<br>
<br>
something else until you
<br>
stop existing completely
<br>
someone get me a fucking beer
<br>
so i can drink it and then bash 
<br>
your head with it 
<br>
i love you so much i want to hurt you
not the lasting kind of hurt
<br>
just the kind that leaves a mark
for a second or two
<br>
<br>
p.s. don’t forget i was here
<br>
p.p.s don’t forget me
<br>
p.p.p.s i love you
<br>
p.p.p.p.s don’t hurt me
<br>
