guns don’t kill people, people with guns kill people
<br>
i was thinking yesterday 
<br>
<br>
about the fact that no one handwrites anything anymore
<br>
i would cherish your
<br>
chicken-scratch kisses
<br>
ink stain bruises on the tips
<br>
of our fingers that smear
<br>
when our hands touch
<br>
leaving messy trails for someone else to follow
<br>
<br>
i wonder what you’re doing
<br>
when you’re next to me
<br>
<br>
my heart is busy driving around 
<br>
the country of your mouth
<br>
i wonder how long it will take for 
<br>
someone to realize that i’ve 
<br>
never kissed you before
<br>
we can pretend to miss things
<br>
that still exist
<br>
